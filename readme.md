# Google Image Bulk Translate

Since google translate doesn't provide an interface to translate images in bulk unless you're registering for the api (as far as i know) and the translate feature for the document doesn't translate the image contained, this package aim to provide a solution to upload the images in bulk to google translate using puppeteer.js

This package help when you have a document that needs to be translated but the document file is only available in image form.
